## Wrapsher is a programming language that compiles to POSIX sh

The point of Wrapsher is to be able to write programs in a "real"
programming language (with types, structured data like lists and
maps, module-based dependency management) and compile them to
a form that runs on "any" system with a POSIX-compliant sh.

The purpose is to solve the same problems that shell scripts do,
such as installers, bootstrappers and CI/CD scripts, but with
a better language that retains the "universality" of the
POSIX shell.
